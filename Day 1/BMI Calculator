# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

# converts the inputs into suitable data types
h = float(height)
w = int(weight)

# does the convertion into a variable weight/height^2
output = w / h ** 2

# converting previous operation into expected data type output
BMI = int(output)

# prints output
print(BMI)
